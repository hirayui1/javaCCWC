Coding Challenges - Build your own WC tool

commands:
- ccwc -c {fileName.txt}
- ccwc -l {fileName.txt}
- ccwc -w {fileName.txt}
- ccwc -w {fileName.txt}
- cat {fileName.txt} | ccwc {command}

In below visual example, I used WinPShell(admin) because I did not want to bother with configuring restrictions. Which is why below syntax is cat {fileName.txt} | .\{.exe/.bat name} {command}
